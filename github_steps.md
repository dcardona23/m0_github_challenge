# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
To establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub, you need to use the command git remote add origin and insert the SSH code for the remote repository. You can check to see if it worked by using the command git remote -v, which should show that there is a remote origin for the repository. Then you can push your work from the local repository to the GitHub repository by using git push.
